# Postit_project3
First project where we would interact with a custom API.
the goal was to be able to create post-its, edit and delete them.

## My_work

Solo project, so i did pretty much everything except the api itself.
We discovered vueJS at the same time, quite fond of the framework compared to laravel and rather easy to learn with.
